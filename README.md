React Sphere is an architectural concept for making a product under a single codebase for mobile, desktop and VR.

### Advantages of react-sphere
- `Follow adaptive design` You can implement the adaptive design for each device types like mobile, desktop and VR
- `Multiple sites / apps` Able to build multiple sites and apps like B2B, whitelabel sites and also tragetting geographical regions by country wise. (eg: French, Arabic) by inheriting or overriding the templates of global app / site (.com)

## Idea
Idea inspired from [Leland Richardson](https://github.com/lelandrichardson) talk on [Chain React 2017: React as a Platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaRtmgaNZos)

## Getting Started
- [Install react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies) If you haven't  installed react native on your machine, follow these steps from [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies) till Create new Application
- Install react-sphere as Gobal
    ```
    $ npm install -g react-sphere
    ```
- Create your project
    ```
    $ react-sphere init project_name
    ```
- After initializing the project, its all react-native and react. you can use your react-native / react commands

## Usage
- Configure the sites in .babelrc file, like below.
    ```
    {
      "presets": [
        "react-native"
      ],
      "plugins": [
        ["transform-inline-environment-variables"],
        ["variable-path-resolver", {
          "envName": "SITE",
          "vars": {
            "m-fr": {"Device": "Mobile", "Site": "Fr" },
            "m-com": {"Device": "Mobile", "Site": "Com"},
            "d-fr": {"Device": "Desktop", "Site": "Fr" },
            "d-com": {"Device": "Desktop", "Site": "Com"},
            "default": {"Device": null, "Site": "Com"}
          },
          "hash": "testing12 3ss3"
        }]
      ]
    }
    ```
- Running a web application (Webpack dev server)
    -  SITE=m-com yarn web // For running your global mobile site
    -  SITE=m-fr yarn web // french mobile site
    -  SITE=d-com yarn web // global desktop site
    -  SITE=d-fr yarn web // french desktop
    - To switch between sites, you may need to clear the compiler cache, for that you can use below command
        ```
        react-sphere switch m-fr web
        ```
- Running react-native app
    - react-native run-ios // For running your global mobile app
    - To change to french app, stop the existing bundling terminal and run below script and reload your app.
        ```
        SITE=m-fr yarn start --reset-cache
        ```
- Produciton build (web sites)
    -  SITE=m-com yarn build
    -  SITE=m-fr yarn build
    -  yarn build:all // this will create builds for your sites mentioned in the .babelrc file
- Production build (mobile apps)
    - SITE=m-fr react-native run-ios --configuration Release
    - Basically prepend SITE={site-name} and follow the steps from [react naitve running-on-device](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html)
